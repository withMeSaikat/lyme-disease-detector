# Lyme Disease Detector

In this project, we are trying to detect lyme disease by analyzing the infection images

 ## Technologies Used:
- Deep Learning
- Image Processing
- Image Segmentation
- Transfer Learning

## Dependencies:
+ [Tensorflow 2](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow) - Inbuilt Deep Learning tools
+ [Keras](https://github.com/keras-team/keras) - Simple and useful deep learning framework
+ [Numpy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy) - For numerical computations
+ [scikit-image](https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image) - For preprocessing images
+ [OpenCV](https://github.com/opencv/opencv) - For various image processing

## Dataset:
The open source data can be downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/sshikamaru/lyme-disease-rashes).
> After unzipping the file, place the RashData folder in the root directory.

## How to use:
1. Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/)
2. Create virtual enviorment.
On the anaconda prompt type-
```sh
conda update conda
```
```sh
conda create -n envname anaconda
```
```sh
conda activate envname
```
> `Note:` Make sure the virtual enviorment is activated before installing tensorflow 2
3. Install TensorFlow 2 (using pip)
```sh
pip install --upgrade tensorflow
```
3. Clone the repository
```sh
cd project_directory
git clone https://github.com/withMeSaikat/lyme-disease-detector.git
cd lyme-disease-detector
```
> Open jupyter notebook from anaconda prompt by typing `jupyter-notebook` while the virtual enviorment is activated.
